# Smartphone based Malaria diagnostics

## Overview

This project aimed to provide a low-cost, reliable, user-friendly method for malaria diagnostics. It includes four main parts: 
* An Android App
*  A blockchian network (based on [ Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/))
*   Deeplearning models (based on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)) 
*   A portable heater for LAMP-based Malaria tests. 

The Android App was designed to concrol the entire system, the blockchain network provided secured data storage, Deeplearning techniques were used to analyse the test results automatically and the heater could provide stable tempreatures for the diagnostic assay.
